Luke Dischiave
ECSE 395 Lab Notebook
Lab #1

Purpose: To set up github classroom for the remaining semester and learn github/markdown basics. To learn how to progam ESP32 microcontroller 

Numbered list of steps I did to complete:
1.) Used github desktop to clone lab-notebook-LukeDischiave to my github
2.) copied README.md into the repo for lab notebook
3.) opened the github repo in obsidian
4.) committed and pushed changes to lab notebook

at the end of the entire assignment) A short reflection on how easy/difficult you  
found the lab assignment (it is recommended to push to GitHub several times,  
each with incremental work, rather than waiting until everything is “done” and  
pushing everything at once)
