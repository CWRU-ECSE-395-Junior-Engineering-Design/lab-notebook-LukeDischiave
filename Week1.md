Luke Dischiave
ECSE 395 Lab Notebook Week #1
01/17/25

Purpose: To set up github classroom for the remaining semester and learn github/markdown basics.

Numbered list of steps I did to complete:
1.) Used github desktop to clone lab-notebook-LukeDischiave to my github
2.) copied README.md into the repo for lab notebook
3.) opened the github repo in obsidian
4.) committed and pushed changes to lab notebook

A short reflection on how easy/difficult you found the lab assignment:
It was confusing at first to figure out the logistics of how to setup github desktop, cloning, and directories. We eventually figured it out mostly. But we're still a little confused.
