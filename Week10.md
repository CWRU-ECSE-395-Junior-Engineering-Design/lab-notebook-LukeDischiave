# Weekly activities:

## For week 10, our team asynchronously improved on our midterm presentation. We also practiced presenting early Thursday morning after I got back from my flight. We got a 97 on our presentation and we didn't go over time. It was a success. Looking forward, Joseph is going to make a more granular timeline for our working prototype.
