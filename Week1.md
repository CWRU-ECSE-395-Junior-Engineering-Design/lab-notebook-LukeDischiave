2.) copied README.md into the repo for lab notebook
3.) opened the github repo in obsidian
4.) committed and pushed changes to lab notebook

#Reflection
It was confusing at first to figure out the logistics of how to setup github desktop, cloning, and directories. We eventually figured it out mostly. But we're still a little confused because we're not sure if we're doing it right. I wasn't sure how to use Obsidian at first. Eventually I figured out I could save the file AFTER I cloned the github repo to my computer using the github desktop app. Also I did not know basic syntax for Obsidian, and hence, no idea how to do headers. Some of the instructions for the lab seemed out of order. But I also managed to figure it out, so they are okay. It was mostly intuitive overall.
