# Weekly activities:
## For week 9, our team asynchronously worked on our midterm presentation. I worked on the intro, background & motivation, functional specs, and technical specs slides. These are also going to be the slides which I present on Friday, 3/21. Robert and Joseph finished the rest of the presentation which involved discussing our prototypes.
