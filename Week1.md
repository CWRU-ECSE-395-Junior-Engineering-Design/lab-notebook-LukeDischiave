Luke Dischiave
ECSE 395 Lab Notebook Week #1
01/17/25

# Purpose 
## To set up github classroom for the remaining semester and learn github/markdown basics.

# Steps
## 1.) Used github desktop to clone lab-notebook-LukeDischiave to my github
## 2.) copied README.md into the repo for lab notebook
## 3.) opened the github repo in obsidian
## 4.) committed and pushed changes to lab notebook

# Reflection
## It was confusing at first to figure out the logistics of how to setup github desktop, cloning, and directories. I didn't entirely understand what was happening, as I wasn't very familiar with github. We eventually figured it out mostly. But we're still a little confused because we're not sure if we're doing it right. I wasn't sure how to use Obsidian at first. Eventually I figured out I could save the file AFTER I cloned the github repo to my computer using the github desktop app. Also I did not know basic syntax for Obsidian, and hence, no idea how to do headers. I also didn't know that I needed a README for my lab notebook, as well as the md for the week as well. After some time, I managed to figure it out. It seems mostly intuitive overall.
