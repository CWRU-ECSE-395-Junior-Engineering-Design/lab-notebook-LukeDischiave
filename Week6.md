# Weekly activities:
## For week 6, we started off with our second stakeholder meeting Sunday morning. We concluded that our stakeholder would like our idea #3, with some aspects of idea #2. We made a document with all the notes we made from the interview. We updated our presentation with feedback from Dr. Block For the lab, I submitted lab #5: Integration exploration. Since I wasn't on campus this thursday or friday, I met with Robert to complete the function specs for our design for cat bowl monitoring system. I submitted this document, and while I'm off campus, I'm thinking of potential prototype ideas.
