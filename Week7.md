# Weekly activities:
## For week 7, our team met and brainstormed ideas for our prototypes. Each of us will be in charge of creating one prototype. I nearly finished my prototype for the cat bowl monitoring system. It's essentially a small, raised cardboard box that has sticky notes on the side that act as either buttons, switches, or LEDs. I'm not fully sure on how to configure the LEDs to monitor the battery life of the device and also the status of how clean the bowl is. For water this is a problem. This is less of a problem with food, where I can just set a timer. Although the biggest problem for our stakeholder was the water refilling. I also modified and submitted the technical specs document on Friday for our team.
