We are fixing our weight sensor, and we have our 3d printed bowl now. 

set up the github so we can contribute to teh code at the same time. 

going to add the lightsleep code to your code after joseph is finished with calibrating the weight sensors. 

need to drill holes in the bowl in order for the LEDs to pop through

need to sand the edges of the bowl because they are too sharp

the factor of the weights needs to be really precise, since they're designed for 50kg and we have 4 of them and they are not measuring nearly that much weight. 
there might also be a minimum weight of aaround half a kilogram.

in terms of the weight sensors, they are too small to fit directly below the bowl. 
we are planning on platforming the bowl in order to fit them all, since it's a prototype this is acceptable. 

now we decided to desolder teh 3 weight sensors and just use one, with two 1k resistors. \


polling rate of our code should be pretty low since it doesn't need to update all the time
